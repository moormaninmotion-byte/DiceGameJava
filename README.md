# DiceGameJava
A single player vs. computer dice game, first to roll 100 wins!

 * A simple, single-file console implementation of the dice game "Pig".
 
  --- GAME RULES ---
 * - The game is played by two players: one human and one computer.
 * - The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.
 * - On your turn, you can "roll" a six-sided die as many times as you want.
 * - The results of each roll are added to your "turn total".
 * - If you decide to "hold", your turn total is added to your main score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
 * - HOWEVER, if you roll a 1, your turn total is lost (reset to 0), and your turn ends immediately.
